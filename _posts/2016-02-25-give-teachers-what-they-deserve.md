description: "A Learning Line for Teachers This summer I got to meet Lyon Terry, my state's teacher of the year for 2015. Lyon told me about something clever he does in his classroom at the beginning of each school year: He takes a big piece of paper and draws an arrow on it, pointing up and to the right, and labels it the Learning Line."
